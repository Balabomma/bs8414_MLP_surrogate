# Balanced 12-run design on the corrected 184-configuration corpus:
# 3 independent retrains at each of 4 base seeds (42, 45, 48, 52).
#
# Purpose: separate the two variance components the reported +/-0.038 conflates.
#   within-seed  - cudnn.benchmark leaves the per-member draw non-deterministic,
#                  so repeated runs at one seed differ. Measured at ~0.018 on
#                  five seed-42 runs.
#   between-seed - seed 42 scored 0.744 against 0.806 for seeds 45/48/52, a gap
#                  of 0.062, i.e. 3.4x the within-seed spread. The eight-run pool
#                  is seed-42-heavy (5 of 8), so its mean is composition-dependent.
#
# All 12 runs are FRESH. The existing eight are not reused: their values are
# already known, so selecting three seed-42 runs from five would be selection on
# outcome. They remain available as an independent replication check.
#
# Design is balanced (n=3 per cell) so the within/between decomposition is a
# plain one-way ANOVA with equal cells - no weighting decisions to defend.
